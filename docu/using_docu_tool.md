## Configuring documentation publishing pipeline

First you need to fork some projects and configure them correctly to set up the documentation independent generation pipeline.

1. Fork the following repos (it means open the links and click on [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) button in the top right corner of the page):
 - API Doc portal template: https://github.com/YaaS/docpad-skeleton-apidocs
 - Sample REST API microservice that we will be documenting: https://github.com/derberg/minerva
 - Sample registry that integrates the template and docu sources: https://github.com/derberg/apidoc-workshop-docu_registry

2. Configuration <br>
Config edits can be done through github.com UI or by using [Git CLI](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) or [GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop/).

 - Modify `chewieConfig.js` file in forked `docpad-skeleton-apidocs` repository. Change the `path` attribute to:
 ```
 path: process.env.REGISTRY_PATH || 'https://github.com/your_github_username/apidoc-workshop-docu_registry.git'
 ```
 - Modify `minerva.json` file in forked `apidoc-workshop-docu_registry` repository. Change the `location` attribute:
 ```
 "location": "https://github.com/your_github_username/minerva"
 ```

## Start the API Doc portal locally

If configuration is completed you have to:

1. Clone your forked `docpad-skeleton-apidocs` repository,
2. Navigate to its local clone in the terminal,
3. Call the following command: `npm run prepare` to install all the dependencies
4. Now call `npm run init` to install inject content into the template
5. Call `npm run start` to start documentation server locally
6. Once the start is completed, open in the browser the following link: http://127.0.0.1:9778/

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

The easiest solution is to publish the API Doc portal on GitHub pages as this service is for free. Of course the generated API Doc portal files can be hosted on any other server as it is pure static content.

1. Create new repository with the following name: `your_github_username.github.io`. It must be public and initialized (You do it in UI during creation, just initialize with a readme file).

2. Modify `chewieConfig.js` file in forked `docpad-skeleton-apidocs` repository.

 - Change the `srcLocation` attribute:
 ```
 srcLocation: 'https://github.com/your_github_username/your_github_username.github.io.git',
 ```
 - Change the `docuUrl` attribute:
 ```
 docuUrl: process.env.docuURL || 'https://your_github_username.github.io',
 ```
 
3. Modify `docpad.coffee` file in forked `docpad-skeleton-apidocs` repository. Change the `url` attribute in the following way:

 ```
 environments:
   prod:
     templateData:
       site:
         url: "https://your_github_username.github.io"
 ```
 
4. Navigate to the local clone of `docpad-skeleton-apidocs` repository in the terminal and do"
 ```
 git pull
 npm run init
 ```

5. Call the following command:
 - On Linux/Mac OS: `NODE_ENV=prod npm run compile`
 - On Windows OS: 
    - `SET NODE_ENV=prod`
    - `npm run compile`

6. Call the following command: `npm run preparePushResult && npm run pushResult`

7. Once the push is completed, open in the browser the following link: http://your_github_username.github.io
